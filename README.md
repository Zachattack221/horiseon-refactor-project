## Description
[Link to live site](https://zachattack221.github.io/horiseon-refactor-project/)

This link takes the user to a refactored website for the company  Horiseon.
The purpose of the project was to consolidate a semantically cumbersome HTML and CSS file. This full process was delineated throughout via comments in the source code.
In addition, the site was tested to ensure all links functioned properly, and the aestetics of the page were held to a certain standard.
